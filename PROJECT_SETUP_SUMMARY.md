# Stunt Car Stadium - Project Setup Summary

## Current Status

This Unity project has been analyzed and prepared for compilation. The following changes and preparations have been made:

1. **Project File Analysis**: The Assembly-CSharp.csproj file was examined and found to be a Unity-generated project file that was partially converted to use the .NET SDK format.

2. **Compilation Attempt**: The project was attempted to be compiled using `dotnet build` but failed due to missing Unity engine references (UnityEngine.dll, etc.).

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - Missing Unity engine assemblies (UnityEngine, UnityEditor, etc.)
   - Unity-specific attributes and types not recognized by standard .NET compilation
   - Large number of errors related to missing types like Vector3, MonoBehaviour, GameObject, etc.

4. **Preparations Made**:
   - Created a README.md with setup instructions
   - Preserved the original project file as Assembly-CSharp.csproj.restored
   - Created a build script with instructions for proper compilation
   - Documented the recommended approaches for building this Unity project

## Next Steps

When moving to a computer with Unity installed:

1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Open the project directly in Unity Editor for development and building
2. **Option 2 (Alternative)**: Restore the original project file format and ensure Unity assemblies are properly referenced

## Files Created/Modified

- README.md - Documentation for project setup
- Assembly-CSharp.csproj.restored - Backup of the original Unity project file format
- build.sh - Build script with instructions

## Unity-Specific Dependencies

This project requires the following Unity components to compile successfully:
- UnityEngine.dll
- UnityEditor.dll
- Other Unity managed assemblies typically found in:
  - Windows: C:\Program Files\Unity\[Version]\Editor\Data\Managed\
  - macOS: /Applications/Unity/[Version]/Unity.app/Contents/Managed/
  - Linux: /path/to/unity/editor/Data/Managed/

The project will not compile successfully with just the .NET SDK unless these Unity assemblies are properly referenced in the project file.
